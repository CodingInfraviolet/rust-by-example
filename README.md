# Introduction

I want to learn the Rust programming language, but have always found it challenging to go through chapters upon
chapters of text.

This project is based on [Slate](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate), and is inspired by [Clojure by Example](https://kimh.github.io/clojure-by-example/).

To view it, see https://codinginfraviolet.github.io/rust-by-example
